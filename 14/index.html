    let age2 = age

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players
    console.log(team, players) // OUTPUT: ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'], ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3]= 'Lux' 
    
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players) // OUTPUT: ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice()

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)
    
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
    team4[3] = 'hola'
    console.log(team4)

    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person
    // captain.number = 99

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number : 99 })
    console.log(captain2) // OUTPUT: { name: "Wes Bos"}, age: 80, number: 99 }
    console.log(person) // OUTPUT: { name: "Wes Bos"}, age: 80}

    // Object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person, number : 10}
    console.log(cap3) // OUTPUT: { name: "Wes Bos"}, age: 80, number: 10 }

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      name: 'nat',
