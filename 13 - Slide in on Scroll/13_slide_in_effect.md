### Debounce

- Limits the number of times a function will run. This is to limit the number of times the `checkSlide` function is called. 
- Prevents your UI code from needing to process every event and also drastically reduces the number of API calls sent to your server.
- Processing every character as itâ€™s entered could harm performance and add unnecessary load to your server.
- Debouncing is mainly used to improve your application's performance.

Debounce is a higher order function that returns another function.
