## This is all about that CSS... ##

`transform-origin: x-axis, y-axis, z-axis`
- This property changes the element's base placement
- Default is `transform-origin: 50%, 50%, 0`

`new Date()`
- Date objects are used to work with dates and times.
- New date objects are instantiated as follows `const date = new Date()`
- There are a number of methods that can be used on the date object, eg. `date.getDay`
- A list of these methods can be found on the [W3School site](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp)


`Element.style.Property = ''`
- This resets a property's styling

TIP:
- Remember to use the devtools to play around with the CSS. You can then copy the code from the devtools and into your project.
- You can easily inline style with `Element.style`
